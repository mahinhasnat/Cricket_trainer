🏏 Cricket Player Evaluation & Selection System 🏏

This is a complete cricket player assessment platform designed for trainers and coaches to evaluate players efficiently and professionally. Players’ performance metrics like bowling speed, line accuracy, batting average, and strike rate are combined with trainer ratings such as batting skill, bowling skill, physical fitness, mental toughness, teamwork, and technical uniqueness (all scored 1–10).

The system automatically analyzes all inputs, calculates an overall performance score, and suggests the player’s ideal role – whether Batsman, Bowler, All-Rounder, or Captain Candidate. It also provides automatic selection status: ✅ Selected, ⚡ Needs Training, or ❌ Not Selected.

Optional trainer comments and player photo can be added for a professional touch. Perfect for official cricket squads, academies, and talent scouting!
